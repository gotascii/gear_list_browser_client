lite-server & Browsersync
---
lite-server is a small wrapper around Browsersync. It configures bs to serve
static files out of the local directory and automatically reloads any connected
browsers whenever it detects any changes. It does this by injecting a js lib
after the body tag of all served .html assets. The lib connects to a shared
websocket and listens for commands. Browsersync also provides a UI that also
connects to the same websocket and issues commands such as reload.

bs-config.json
---
Contains browsersync configuration that causes the browsersync ui, which runs
in the browser, to connect to the websocket through haproxy.

typings.json
---
Many js libraries have features and syntax that the Typescript compiler doesn't
recognize natively. Typescript definition files (...d.ts) are used to inform the
compiler about these js libraries. Not all npm packages include these definition
files. The Typings tool scans installed npm packages and creates definition
files where necessary by running `npm typings install`. References to created
definition files are automatically stored in typings.json.

When adding js library dependencies to the app, first add then to package.json.
Then, run `npm install`. The package.json defines a `postinstall` hook that will
automatically run `typings install`. Finally, configure systemjs such that it
can locate the primary .js file in the library. The map will usually point to
the /dist directory. The package config will usually point main to
lib-name.min.js and will have the defaultExtension set to 'js'.
